h2. Readme for TinyG Release 0.93

Release 0.93 is the last planned pre-production release for TinyG. Many things have been fixed since 0.92 and major new functionality has been added. At this point we think the code base is pretty solid.

Key TinyG features are:
* 6 axis motion (XYZ linear axes, ABC rotary axes)
* Constant jerk acceleration / deceleration planning (3rd order planning)
* 50 Khz max step rate with enhanced interpolation for jitter-free stepping
* XON/XOFF protocol over serial to simplify code streaming
* Comprehensive configuration system ('$' commands)
* Machine position and state status displays ('?' command)
* Obeys NIST RS274/NGCv3 with add'l guidance from Smid's CNC Programming Handbook v3

New functionality added in 0.93:
* Feedhold and resume - Use ! to stop, ~ to resume - maintains position thought
* Software reset (abort) - hit ^x to reset from the USB port
* Separate machine and work coordinate systems - M54-M59 support 6 work coordinate systems
* Full support for G92 offsets
* Homing support - full search + latch homing cycles on any or all 6 axes
* Spindle support - on, off and direction (M3, M4, M5)
* Coolant support - on, off (M7, M8, M9)
* Automatic status reports for "DRO" style output during motion
* JSON interface for simplified control from high-level interfaces
* Advanced arc planning - full acceleration / deceleration and cornering control
* Built in self tests using the $test=N command
* Friendly-names added to configuration system 
* Restore "factory" default settings using the $defaults=1 command
* Enhanced help functions - type 'h' at the command line
