TinyG Introduction
========

TinyG is a port of grbl to the Atmel xmega that runs on the TinyG hardware. Some differences are:

* 6 axis motion (XYXABC axes)
* jerk controlled motion for acceleration planning (3rd order motion planning)
* status displays ('?' character)
* XON/XOFF protocol over serila
* config is necessarily different to take into account the larger number of settings

See the Synthetos website for more details.
